    <h3>Step 1</h3>
     <p>
        Create a new header using h1 tags and input "Divs and Spans".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        Create a "div" tag with an "id" attribute set to "first_div".
    </p>
    <p>
        "div"s are what's called a block level element meaning that it's width is equal to it's parent's width.
    </p>
    <p>
        To demonstrate, the "div" you created will have it's background color changed to red.
