    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <p>
        This is part of a multipart exercise that will deal with working on the same piece of HTML code. As always, just follow the instructions to complete this exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML forms are used to pass data to a server.
    </p>
    <p>
        An HTML form can contain input elements like text fields, checkboxes, radio-buttons, submit buttons and more.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
        Create a new header using h1 tags and input "Forms".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        Create a "form" beginning and end tag. Give this tag two attributes: "action" and make it equal to "#" (including the quotes); "method" and make it equal to "post" (again, including the quotes).
    </p>
    <p>
        You should end up with something like:
<pre>
&lt;form action="#" method="post"&gt;&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        For the first time in these exercises, you're going to use a self-closing tag. In this case the self-closing tag is an "input" tag. Add an "input" opening tag between your form tags and instead of adding &lt;/input&gt; after it, right at the end of the opeing tag add an addition space followed by a slash.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is an example of a self-closing input tag:
<pre>
&lt;input /&gt;
</pre>
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
        All "input" tagg have at least 2 attributes associated with them. The first attribute is "type" which, in the case of your "input" tag should be set to "input". The second attribute is the "name" attribute. Again, in the case of your input tag, set the "name" attribute to "name".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>
        Add a final attribute called "id" to the "input" tag and give it the value of "name".
    </p>
    <h3>Optional Step 6</h3>
    <p>
        Add a "label" tag before your "input" tag and give it the "for" attribute and the value for that attribute shoudl be set to "name". Set the data between the opening and closing "label" tags to "Name:".
    </p>
    <p>
        Doing this will allow you to click the "Name: " text and the browser will place your cursor in the input box to start editing.
    </p>

        Once you've completed these steps, refresh the web page.
