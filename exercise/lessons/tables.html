    <h2>Links, Lists and Tables (Part 3)</h2>
    <p>
        This is the last part of a multipart exercise that will deal with working on the same piece of HTML code. As always, just follow the instructions to complete this exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML tables allow you to arrange data -- text, images, links, lists, etc. -- into rows and columns of cells.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
        Around your newly created lists, you are going to wrap a few different tags. First wrap each list with "td" (cell) tags. There should be two cells (one for each of your lists).
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        Wrap both lists and "td" tags in "tr" (row) tags. There will currently only be a single row in your table so there should only be a single open and a single closed "tr" tags.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        Wrap your new table row in "table" tags. Your two lists will be side by side now instead of one on top of the other.
    </p>
    <h3>Optional Step 4</h3>
    <p>
        Add an additional row before the row that holds your two lists. Instead of using "td" tags, use "th" (table header) tags to be used as cells and fill in two "th" tags with "Unordered List" and "Ordered List". This will give your two table cells headers explaining the content below them.
