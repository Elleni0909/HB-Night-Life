    <h2>Links, Lists and Tables</h2>

        This is a multipart exercise that will deal with working on the same piece of HTML code. As always, just follow the instructions to complete this exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
        Links (also known as anchor tags, hyperlinks or "A" tags) are a way websites get from place to place.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
        Create a new header using h1 tags and input "Links, Lists and Tables".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        Create an "a" link after the header you just created. (Remember, "a" tags need both an opening and a closing tag.)
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        Input the words "Hackbright Academy" between your new "a" tag.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
        We're going to do something different to this "a" tag that we haven't done to previous tags. We're going to add an attribute to the tag. Specifically, we need to add the "href" (Hyperlink Reference) attribute to the opening "a" tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        To add the "href" attribute, input a space after the letter "a" in your opening tag followed by href=&quot;&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, put "http://www.hackbrightacademy.com" between the &quot;s in the new "href" attribute.
    </p>
    <h3>Optional Step 5</h3>
    <p>
        Add more links to some of your favorite sites using "a" tags. (Don't forget the "href" attribute.)
    </p>
