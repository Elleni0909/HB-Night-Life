    <h2>Forms (Part 3)</h2>
    <p>
        This is part of a multipart exercise that will deal with working on the same piece of HTML code. As always, just follow the instructions to complete this exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this exercise, you're going to be adding a couple new form elements. Radio form elements are for between multiple options. Checkbox elements are for opting in or selecting multiple options.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
        Again, staying inside of the form tags that you made, after your "select" box, append two new "input" tags. Remember, "input" tags must have the "type" and "name" attributes specified. Set your type attribute for both of your new tags to "radio" and the name attributes should be set to "gender".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        An additional attribute for each of these input tags should be "value". Set the "value" attribute for the first tag to "male" and the for the second tag, "female".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        Other attributes for radio inputs like these are "disabled" and "checked". Since this is an all-female class, let's disable the male selection by adding the "disabled" attribute and setting its value to "true".
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, let's make "female" be the default selection and add the "checked" attribute to the second tag with the value of "checked".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
        So far you have only added the radio inputs themselves, let's add some labels so you know what you're clicking.
    </p>
    <p>
        You need to add an additional attribute to both input tags. The attirbute to add is "id" and set their values to "male" and "female" respectively.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>
        Just like in "Forms (Part 2)," add a "label" tag before each of your "input" tags and give them the "for" attribute and the value for those attributes should be set to "male" and "female". Set the data between the opening and closing "label" tags to "Male" and "Female".
    </p>
    <p>
        (In case you haven't noticed the "for" attribute in the "label" tags corrisponds to the "id" attribute in the form element.)
    </p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>
        Add another self-closing "br" tag after your radio inputs.Now you're going to add a checkbox form element. To do that, create an "input" tag and give the "type" attribute the value of "checkbox". Set the "name", "value" and "id" attributes for the checkbox input to "agree".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>
        Finally, add a "label" tag after your "input" tag and give ift the "for" attribute and the value for that attribute should be set to "agree". Set the data between the opening and closing "label" tag to "Agree to the Terms of Service?".
