    <h2>Forms (Part 3)</h2>
    <p>
        This is part of a multipart exercise that will deal with working on the same piece of HTML code. As always, just follow the instructions to complete this exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this exercise, we're going to be adding a couple new form elements. Radio form elements are for between multiple options. Checkbox elements are for opting in or selecting multiple options.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
        Again, staying inside of the form tags that you made, after your "select" box, append two new "input" tags. Remember, "input" tags must have the "type" and "name" attributes specified. Set your type attribute for both of your new tags to "radio" and the name attributes should be set to "gender".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        An additional attribute for each of these input tags should be "value". Set the "value" attribute for the first tag to "male" and the for the second tag, "female".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        Other attributes for radio button inputs like these are "disabled" and "checked". Since this is an all-female class, let's disable the male selection by adding the "disabled" attribute and setting its value to "true".
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, let's make "female" be the default selection and add the "checked" attribute to the second tag with the value of "checked".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>

    </p>
