    <h2>Links, Lists and Tables (Part 2)</h2>
    <p>
        This is a multipart exercise that will deal with working on the same piece of HTML code. As always, just follow the instructions to complete this exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lists in HTML are just like lists in real life. We're going to define an "li" (list item) before we define the list as a whole.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
        Around your newly created link(s), add your beginning and ending "li" tags. If you have more than one link, add additional "li" tags around those as well.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        Wrap your list item(s) with "ul" (unordered list) tags. This will create a list with generic bullet points next to each of your list items.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        Copy your entire unordered list. And paste the copy below that list.
    </p>
    <p>
        Change your "ul" tags in this copied list to "ol" (ordered list) tags. The HTML term "ordered list" is a bit of a misnomer as it won't sort the list for you but will change the bullet points from generic dots to numbers.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
        If you haven't already, add some additional links (inside list items) to your lists.

        Once you've completed these steps, refresh the web page.
