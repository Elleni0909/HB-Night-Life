    <h2>Layout Preperations</h2>
    <p>
        You'll need to setup your manual with some additional "div" tags to begine the next steps which are CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JS (Javascript).
    </p>
    <p>
        To begin, you'll need to wrap all the code you wrote "div" tags to help segment and organize your code.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
        Wrap all the code within the "body" tag with a "div" tag with the "id" attribute set to "content_column".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        Before this new div you need to make a place (in the code) for a navigation bar.
    </p>
    <p>
        Create a "div" with an "id" attribute set to "nav_column" making sure it is before the "content_column".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        Now you need to wrap all the code inside the "body" tag again with another "div" tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wrap all the code within the "body" tag with a "div" tag with the "id" attribute set to "content".
    </p>
    <p>
        You have just one more "div" to go.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
        Now you need to wrap all the code inside the "body" tag again with another "div" tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wrap all the code within the "body" tag with a "div" tag with the "id" attribute set to "page_container".
    </p>
    <p>
        I know all these "div" tags seem silly now, but it will make your coding moving forward much easier. You'll see why when you move to CSS and JS.
