    <h2>Forms (Part 2)</h2>
    <p>
        This is part of a multipart exercise that will deal with working on the same piece of HTML code. As always, just follow the instructions to complete this exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this exercise, we're going to be adding a couple new form elements. Textarea form elements are for inputting large, multi-line amounts of text. Select/Option elements are for creating dropdown menu boxes.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
        Staying inside of the form tags that you made in the last exercise and after your input box, append a self closing "br" (line break) tag followed by a new "textarea" tag. Unlike the "input" tag, "textarea" needs to have it's own closing tag.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        Add two attributes to your "textarea" tag. The first attribute is "name" and its value is "bio". The second attribue is "id" and its value is also "bio".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        Let's give the input box and text area some labels so we can keep track of them before continuing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Add a "label" tag before your "input" tag and give it the "for" attribute and the value for that attribute should be set to "name". Set the data between the opening and closing "label" tags to "Name:".
    </p>
    <p>
        Add another "label" tag before your "textarea" tag and give it the "for" attribute and the value for that attribute should be set to "bio". Set the data between the opening and closing "label" tags to "Bio:".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
        Now back to the form elements. Add another self-closing "br" tag after your text area and create a new "select" tag. The two attributes to be added to the the "select" tag are, again, "name" and "id". Create the two attributes and give them both the value of "month".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>
        Inside of the "select" tag, add 12 (yes, 12) "option" tags. Each of these "option" tags will correspond to a month of the year. Create an attribute called "value" for each "option" tag and set "value" attributes to "January" through "December".
    </p>
    <p>
        Input text between the opening and closing "option" tags equal to the months as well.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>
        Add another "label" tag before your "select" tag and give it the "for" attribute and the value for that attribute should be set to "month". Set the data between the opening and closing "label" tags to "Birth Month:".
    </p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>
        Add a self-closing "br" tag after the closing "select" tag.
    </p>
