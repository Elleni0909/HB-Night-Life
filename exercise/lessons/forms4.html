    <h2>Forms (Part 4)</h2>
    <p>
        This is part of a multipart exercise that will deal with working on the same piece of HTML code. As always, just follow the instructions to complete this exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this exercise, we're going to be adding a couple new form elements. Radio form elements are for between multiple options. Checkbox elements are for opting in or selecting multiple options.
    </p>
    <p>
        What is a form without a submit button?
    </p>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
        After your checkbox's label, add a self-closing "br" tag.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        After that "br" tag, create a new "input" tag with "type", "id", "name" and "value" attributes set to "submit".
    </p>

        Once you've completed these steps, refresh the web page.
